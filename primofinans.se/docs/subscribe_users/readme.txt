before we added reqId, he had another developer activate the feed and change it ti another company called:
Marketingplatformand this is what stopped working around the time you did the reqId updateHe sent me these details meanwhile for logging in:

Primofinans:
jh@lacuna-digital.com
UVsCU75hp@P9GSdTRxs7eeNI

Marketingplatform:
lacuna-digital_dk
Markersej2020I'm assuming the development he had someone else do towards MarketingPlatform is still there, so I'm hoping that it is just activating it again somehow

fount this one: https://marketingplatform.com/api/php/

not sure if it is as simple as getresponse, but I see that we had created a webservice in our system, though one of the parameters is one called postUrl which contains: https://api.mailmailmail.net/v1.1/Subscribers/AddSubscriberToList
So perhaps, one can just post directly to that url for creating new users
and then add username, token and listId plus personal data
