<p>
<a name="whatineed"></a>
<span class="top_feat">1. What do I need to become an affiliate?</span><br/>
Nothing! 
Except your desire to be an affiliate. 
</p>
<p>
You don't even need a website (although having your own website helps). You can promote our product via search engines 
(<a href="http://netquality.wingcube.hop.clickbank.net/" target=_blank>click here to learn how</a>), 
postings in internet forums, or simply email to all your friends and people you know with your affiliate link to our product. 
</p>
All you need to do is to send a visitor to our site via a special link (called 'affiliate link'), and if he or she buys anything 
from us, you will get 30% of the sale value.
</p>
<p>
Those are the results you can get:
</p>

<p>
<a name="howpaid"></a>
<span class="top_feat">2. How do I know I will be paid for my referral?</span><br/>
The program is powered by Post Affiliate Pro, the leading affiliate tracking software.
Post Affiliate Pro uses combination of cookies and IP address to track referrals for best possible reliability. 
When the visitor follows your affiliate link to our site, our affiliate system registers this referral and places cookie on his or her computer. 
When the visitor pays for the product, affiliate system checks for cookie (if not found, checks for IP address of referral) and credits 
your account 30% of the purchase value. 
<br/>
This process is absolutely automatic. All your referrals will be properly tracked.
</p>
<p>
Post Affiliate Pro is used by thousands of Internet merchants and affiliates world-wide. 
</p>
<p>
<a name="payment"></a>
<span class="top_feat">3. How is the payment handled?</span><br/>
You can choose if you want to be paid by PayPal or by wire transfer, as well as minimum payout value ($100 minimum). 
We do not support regular checks at the moment.
<br/>
Payments are issues in US dollars, and are paid <b>once a month</b>, always on 15th. 
</p>
<p>
<a name="setup"></a>
<span class="top_feat">4. How do I set up an account?</span><br/>
Setting up an account is very easy and it's completely FREE. You don't have to pay for becoming an affiliate.

or place ads in pay-per-click search engines, so you can start sending customers to our web site.

<span class="top_feat">6. Can I promote you through pay-per-click search engines?</span><br/>
YES! You can promote us through pay-per-click search engines. In fact, this type of promotion becomes 
increasingly popular and we are aware of several affiliates promoting our products in this way and making a very good profit. 
(Well, they keep promoting us month after month, which tells you something, doesn't it?)

<p><strong>A few ways to make money with our affiliate program</strong></pr>

<ol>
<li><strong>Write a review of some of our products</strong>, letting people know how good it is. 
Include your affiliate link at the end of the review. Post your review to free sites such 
as <a href="http://www.GoArticles.com" target=_blank>GoArticles.com</a> & <a href="http://www.EzineArticles.com" target=_blank>EzineArticles.com</a>. 
</li>
<li><strong>Create a free blog</strong> (web log) at sites such as Blogger.com, and post your review of the Post Affiliate Pro, 
including your affiliate link. Then "ping" your blog at a site such as Pingomatic.com, so it gets picked up quickly by search engines.
</li>

<li><strong>Join popular marketing forums</strong> such as WarriorForum.com, and make frequent contributions to popular threads there. 
Be sure to go into your forum profile and edit your "signature". Make a signature that includes your Post Affiliate Pro affiliate link, 
or a link to your own Post Affiliate Pro "review" website. That way, every time you make a post, anyone who sees it will see your 
signature and potentially click on your affiliate link.
</li>

<li>Once every few weeks <strong>post a press release</strong> at PRweb.com, in which you include your favorable review of Post Affiliate Pro program, 
along with your affiliate link. If you pay them $80, they will guarantee that your press release is picked up by all major search 
engines, potentially sending you thousands of visitors.
</li>

<li>If you own an email list of <strong>newsletter</strong> subscribers or other people who have opted in to receive email offers from you, 
send them an email telling them about our website, and feel free to use some text from our homepage in your email. Include 
your affiliate link at the end of the email. You can even use our email sample above. 
<br/>
*NOTE - We do not tolerate spamming in 
any way. 
</li>

<li><strong>Pay-Per-Click</strong> (PPC):
Using a PPC account from Google Adwords, Overture, or many others, you can easily generate income with the SAMPLE affiliate program. 
You can either send people directly to us using your affiliate link in your PPC ads, or you can create your own website in which you have 
a review of our product, followed by your affiliate tracking link. 
</li>

<li><strong>Upgrade yourself</strong><br/>
Being affiliate is not exceptionally difficult, but there are some tricks and techniques that can improve your results.
Learn from the best - <a href="http://www.superaffiliatehandbook.com/cbae/?a=Zkjh06wHjL" target=_blank>SuperAffiliate Handbook</a> is 
recommended reading for every affiliate.
